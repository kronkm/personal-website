Hey! I'm Mike Kronk - I'm a Front End Engineer based in Raleigh, NC.

I've been building things on the web for most of my life. I feel best
working on the front end because I can simultaneously get creative, solve technical problems, and interact
with lots of different people and systems.

These days, I'm most interested in the React ecosystem - especially frameworks
that make building and deploying full-featured React apps easier like Gatsby and Next.js.
I also love learning about tools for building with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="__blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamstack</a> architecture.

I'm having fun outside of work, too. I've competed in 5 strength sport competitions,
baked over 50 loaves of sourdough bread, and just started pretending to play the bass
guitar again for the first time in a long time.
