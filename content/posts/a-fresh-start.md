title: A Fresh Start
description: And why I redesigned this website yet again.
---
I've just rebuilt my personal website for somewhere around the sixth time! I've done this for several reasons:

1. Itâ€™s needed a design refresh for a while and especially a friendlier layout for smaller viewports.
2. I wanted to refresh my Gatsby knowledge and this was the perfect opportunity to do so.
3. I'm continually getting more experience that I want to write about and include here, instead of just my usual career summary.
4. Building a new project that I'll definitely use is fun and makes me feel good.
5. Consolidating other properties and ideas, detailed below.

So I previously wrote about soft skills for software developers on a blog called Cordial Coder from 2016-2018. It was hosted on <a href="https://ghost.org" target="__blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost</a> and had a decent number of subscribers with virtually no marketing, so I think there's certainly an audience for that kind of thing.

It was a fun experiment and creative exercise, but I've also become interested in writing about more technical topics as well - especially those related to the front end ecosystem.

And that's how we got here. I want to consolidate all of my writing here, at least for now. I'll eventually republish older posts from Cordial Coder as well. Hang around for posts about front end development and working in tech!
